EDA is a process of analyzing, summarizing, and visualizing data before modeling. 
Key steps include:
- Understanding the Data: Load, inspect structure, and check types.
- Handling Missing Data: Identify and address gaps.
- Generating Summary Statistics: Compute mean, median, std deviation.
- Detecting Outliers: Use boxplots or statistical methods.
- Visualizing Data Distributions: Histograms and count plots for patterns.
- Examining Feature Relationships: Correlation matrices and scatter plots.
- Identifying Patterns and Trends: Grouping and analyzing variations.
- Feature Engineering & Transformation: Creating new features, scaling, encoding.
- Documenting Insights: Summarizing key observations for further analysis.
